# babysitter-kata
To view my work, open the index.html file in any browser.

This is my first kata, so I tried to take it one rule at a time and thoroughly test my work as I went to ensure my logic was working as expected.
While I don't have experience with any testing software, I included the ability to manually test the logic as well as included several hardcoded test cases to make sure everything was working. I've included my thoughts and some clarification as comments in my code.
As I went through the kata, I refactored and changed my code and committed with each new rule to show my changes along the way.
